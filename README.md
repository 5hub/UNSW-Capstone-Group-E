### Brief project description

Energy demand forecasting is a vital challenge to everyone involved in the energy sector whether it be governments, market bodies or decision makers. Our reliance on reliable and cost-effective energy has grown drastically over the past few decades and throughout time there have been several irrefutable indications of just how valuable accurate energy forecasting can be. One of which is the 1973 oil crisis which saw oil prices rise 400% in the span of 5 months.

The purpose of this project is to develop forecasting model that will aim at providing a piece of analysis that could be used by a business or market body that operates within the energy sector to add value or ease their decision-making process.


## Repository structure

The repository has the following folder structure:
- Data Exploration: Each Team member will independently work and explore the Data in Week 2. This folder has five additional sub-folders. Each Sub-Folder is allocated to an individual team member so that they can store their work/insights in the subfolder assigned to the individual. Later the team will collaborate and discuss each individual's findings to determine the next step.
- agendas: agendas for each weekly meeting with lecturers (left 24h before the next meeting)
- checklists: teamwork checklist or a link to an account in a project task management tool
- data: datasets for analysis
- gantt_chart: Gantt chart or a link to an account in a project task management tool
- minutes: minutes for each meeting (left not more than 24h after the corresponding meeting)
- report: This folder includes both the RMarkdown report (work in progress) as well as the Project Plan Report.
- src: source code
