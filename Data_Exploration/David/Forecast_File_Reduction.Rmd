I wish to reduce the size of the forecast_nsw dataset so that we can store it on the GitHub repository.

```{r}
#library(zip)

# Import forecast dataset. This will need to be changed to suit your own local directories       
fcst_nsw <- read.csv('F:/Users/Dave/Desktop/forecastdemand_nsw.csv', header = T)

# Remove PREDISPATCHSEQNO and REGIONID
# PREDISPATCHSEQNO is a descending series of numbers that correspond to forecasts taken over time, something like a primary key for each forecast conducted. The same information is still contained within the data if required.
# REGIONID is just 'NSW1'
fcst_nsw <- fcst_nsw[, -c(1,2)]

# Export the NSW_df to csv
write.csv(fcst_nsw, file = gzfile("forecastdemand_nsw_reduced.csv.gz"), row.names = FALSE)
#write.csv(fcst_nsw,  zip("forecastdemand_nsw_reduced.csv.zip"), row.names = FALSE)

```
Will need to use fread in order to unzip a .gz file

Done!
